Welcome to Pysa project page
----------------------------

Pysa is a configuration reverse engineering software, which is aimed to
help anyone who wants to replicate an existing computer configuration -
and not simply clone the entire machine. It can be used to migrate
configurations from one computer to another (including physical machines
to virtual Clouds), backup existing configurations, or for any other
migration purpose.

Install
-------

Pysa has been designed for UNIX Operating Systems. However, only Linux
based distributions are supported for now (tested on Ubuntu, Debian,
Cent OS, RedHat and Amazon Linux latest and LTS versions). More will
come later.

There are two ways to install Pysa: using the sources files or using the
PyPI packages repository.

Using PyPI (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Ensure pip is setup on your computer (you can alternatively use other
   PyPI managers, like easy\_install)
-  Setup Pysa in its latest version pip install pysa
-  Run Pysa (see documentation)

Sources setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Clone this git repo
   ``git clone https://github.com/MadeiraCloud/pysa.git``
