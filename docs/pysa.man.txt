NAME

   pysa - Reverse Engineer Server Configurations

SYNOPSIS

   pysa [ -hpq ] [ -m module-name ] [ -o output-path ] [ -f
   filter-config-path ]

DESCRIPTION

   pysa scans your system and reverse engineers its configurations for
   easy replication.

   pysa was born from the simple idea that today, while the "cloud
   revolution" is in progress, it is still hard to keep track of the
   actual configuration of our machines and easily replicate it on another
   machine.

   pysa is able to scan your system, looking for different resources to
   deploy and generates some "autoconf" tools script to deploy it later on
   another computer.

   See RESOURCES section for complete list of managed resources.

   pysa is able to generates the configuration in puppet format (see
   [3]puppet(1) man page).

OPTIONS

   -h, --help
          Display the short help.
   -p, --puppet
          Generates Puppet output.
   -q, --quiet
          Activate quiet mode and displays only error messages. By
          default, pysa displays all log messages.
   -m module-name, --module module-name
          Choose output module name.
          Default value: pysa
   -o output-path, --output output-path
          Choose the output filter for generated scripts.
          Default value: output
   -f filter-config-path, --filter filter-config-path
          Specify a filter configuration file.
          See FILTERS section for more details.



RESOURCES

   This section describes all the resources scanned by pysa

   By default, all item described are scanned. However, you can apply some
   filters to avoid or specify some. See the FILTERS section.

   At the current state, the resources objects and keys are similar to
   Puppet types.

   Please see AUTOCONF TOOLS MODULES section to be sure to be able to
   handle all scanned resources.

configuration files - file

   pysa scans (and stores in output module) all files located in a
   specific location. Default /etc

   Primary key: path

packages - package

   pysa is able to scan all packages provided by yum , apt-get , python
   pip ( pypi ), ruby gems , nodejs packaged modules ( npm ) and php
   packages managers ( pear and pecl ).

   Furthermore, pysa is able to detect repositories rpm packages if yum is
   not present.

   Primary key: name

services - service

   pysa detects all startup services managed by upstart and SysV init
   scripts.

   Please see NOTES section.

   Primary key: name

hosts - host

   pysa scans and reproduces existing hostname associations (default
   /etc/hosts ).

   Primary key: name

users - user

   pysa scans and reproduces existing users ( /etc/passwd ).

   Primary key: name

groups - group

   pysa scans and reproduces existing groups ( /etc/groups ).

   Primary key: name

mounts - mount

   pysa scans and reproduces existing mount points ( /etc/fstab ).

   Primary key: device

crons - cron

   pysa scans and reproduces user's crons.

   Primary key: name

ssh keys - key

   pysa scans and reproduces root SSH keys (default /root/.ssh ). The scan
   must be done by root to assure this feature.

   SSH keys are manages as files.

   Primary key: name

sources repositories - source

   pysa is able to recognize all source repositories managed by the most
   common SCM ( subversion , git and mercurial ) present in the system.

   Primary key: path

package managers repositories - repository

   pysa scans and reproduces yum and apt-get repositories.

   Primary key: name

AUTOCONF TOOLS MODULES

   This section lists the autoconf tools' modules which may be used.

   Modules are used for particular features and are only needed in some
   particular cases. Of course, modules (as with the autoconf tools) have
   to be installed on the new machine, not the original one.

Puppet modules

   willdurand/nodejs:     add npm package manager support

   nodes/php:              add php package manager support

   puppetlabs/vcsrepo:     add scm (sources) support

   to install a Puppet module: puppet module install *module-name*

FILTERS

   pysa integrates a powerful filters engine, which allows you to adapt
   its behavior to your needs.

   A filter file is composed of sections, keys and values. In some
   specific cases sections and/or keys can be split using a '.' (see below
   for more details).

   A key can be tagged with '_' at the front to be considered as "action"
   key. An action key is a key representing a specific action in the
   section (see below).

   If some parameters conflict then the result may be harmful, please use
   it carefully. Don't hesitate to report any abnormal output to us.

   Some improvements are planned in this section.

common action keys

   _contentrefer
          This key acts as a pointer. All the content of the referred
          section will be interpreted in the section.
          This key should be set alone, as all keys will be replaced.



addition section

   section description
          This section is used to add or modify some values.
          It can sounds similar to the replace section, but works in a
          completely different way:
               - The key is based on section key instead of content to rep
          lace
               - It is replaced at the scanning step, while the "
          replacement " section is done at the output generation step
          Remember that " addition " is used to add/set a concrete
          parameter, while " replace " is used to replace some content.
          The section name can be separate in multiple subsections using a
          dot '.', always starting by " addition " keyword:
               - "addition.resource_type" will replace values for all obje
          cts of resource_type
               - "addition.resource_type.key.value" will replace only the
          values for the objects where the key/value match the requirement
          The key represents the resource key.
          The value represents the resource value.
   section format
          section_key = section_value
   section action keys
          No action key for this section.



discard section

   section description
          This section is used to specify which object should or shouldn't
          be discard.
          The key is separated in to two sub-keys by a dot '.', which
          represents the object type for the first one and the attribute
          name for the second one.
          The values can be seen as a list of attributes separated by a
          coma ','.
          The joker '*' can be used to specify to match all characters.
   section format
          object.attribute_name = attribute1, attribute2*, ...
   section action keys
          _resources: resource names
                      Select which resources to be scanned, use it careful
          ly, some resources might depend on others.



replace section

   section description
          This section is used to replace any kind of content.
          The section name can be separated into multiple subsections
          using a dot '.', always starting by " replace " keyword:
               - "replace" will replace all values for all objects.
               - "replace.object" will replace all values for the selected
           object.
               - "replace.object.field" will replace only the values assoc
          iated with the field in the selected object.
          The key represents the new value.
          The value(s) represents the target to replace.
   section format
          new_value = old_value1, old_value2, ...
   section action keys
          _replaceall: true/false
                       REQUIRED
                       Select the filtering mode (replace all except -true
          - or replace none except -false-)
                       default: true _except: primary_keys_values



update section

   section description
          This section is used to specify which " package " should be
          updated. This section has been created due to the lack of old
          packages in many repositories.
          A list of package names is specified as values of the " except "
          key, separated by a coma ','.
          The joker '*' can be used to specify to match all characters.
   section format
          except = package1, package2*, *package3, *package4*, ...
   section action keys
          _update: true/false
                   REQUIRED
                   Select the filtering mode (update all except -true- or
          update none except -false-)
                   default: false



USAGE EXAMPLES

   See /usr/share/doc/pysa for configuration file examples.

NOTES

   pysa is currently in and so does not (always) provide 100% functional
   results. This comes from the architectural choices that we've made. For
   example, pysa does not (yet) support the addition of user's packages,
   simply because we can't ensure the availability of these packages on
   the new system.

   Furthermore, pysa depends on "autoconf" tools. This means that if a
   feature is not supported by one of these tools, pysa can't provide it.
   For example, it is currently impossible to use upstart services on a
   redhat-based platform, as it is impossible to use npm package manager
   on Ubuntu.

   Please don't hesitate to contact us for any kind of feedback, advice or
   requirement: [4]pysa@madeiracloud.com.

   If you have a question about a specific source file, you can also
   contact the author directly (see the AUTHOR section)
